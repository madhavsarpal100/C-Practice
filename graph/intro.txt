A tree is a graph that is 1)connected and 2)acyclic

In a disconnected graph..the connected sub graphs are called connected components

min no edges is n-1 and max n(n-1)/2 ....for a connected graph

graph implementation

1)edge list(list vertices and then edge pair in array)
-not good because search for an edge between two vertices will 
search whole array which might have 0(n^2) edges stored.

2)adjacency list (store vertices in array and each vertice has own array
which stores its adjacent vertices )
-checking if there is edge bw two can be upto o(n) but if adjacent 
vertices stored in hashmap then 0(1) too.

3)adjacency matrix (2d array stores if edge is there or not)
- very fast but takes lot of storage space specially if
sparce graph ..n^2 space no matter what where adjacency list
could have taken less space beacuse it only stores link that exist
